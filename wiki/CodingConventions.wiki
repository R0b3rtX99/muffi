#summary Coding conventions for muffi coders.

= Introduction =

This is just a whiplist of how to effectively name things when writing patches to the core muffi framework, or for submitting scripts, etc. It's not hard and fast, but realize that we will change your code to make sure its muffi-ized!

== Conventions ==

_Method Names_

Name all methods with lowercase and underscores:

method_name_like_this()

_Detour Addresses_

When allocating a detour page, or a block of memory where we will write instructions use:

stub_address

_Resolved Function Addresses_

When you are doing an imm.getAddress("kernel32.IsDebuggerPresent") type call, name your returned address:

function_address

_Writing to Memory_

For task critical memory writes, make sure that you do a length check afterwards. Something like this:

{{{

bytes_written = self.imm.writeMemory(function_address,patch_code)

if bytes_written < len(patch_code):
    raise mfx("The memory write failed.")
}}}

Use bytes_written as the variable name for these checks.
